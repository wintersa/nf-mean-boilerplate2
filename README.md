## About
This is the NForce IT M.E.A.N Boilerplate. The goal of the boilerplate is to develop quickly new web applications.
The main website of the company, is using this boilerplate as well. The goal is to build easily upon this boilerplate. 

Either use this Folder as a completely new Project (like the one in the NodeJS Installation Lecture) or just pick the files you want to replace in your own Project.
The most important Files/Folders (i.e. Files/Folders that changed) are the following:
<br/>
<ul>
   <li>..public/vendor</li>
      <ul>
         <li>This directory contains only the libraries the app uses. Copy and Past libs from node_modules directory.</li>
      </ul>
   <li>..routes</li>
      <ul>
         <li>This directory contains files for NodeJs routing.</li>
      </ul>
   <li>..views</li>
      <ul>
         <li>This directory contains files for NodJs views.</li>
      </ul>
</ul>
## Notes
This boilerplate is a alpha build. The repository experience is under going a lot of changes, and more to come in the future.
